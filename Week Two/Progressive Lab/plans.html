                        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                        <p>At the current moment in time, I am not entirely certain what my future plans are. I am
                            looking to go
                            into the field of Conputer Science. Over the past 4 years, I have worked for a small
                            company
                            in Las
                            Vegas, Nevada called Code Central. At Code Central, we teach children 7 to 17 learn how
                            to
                            code. I
                            feel that I am able to help further these childrens careers and helping them on the path
                            of
                            learning
                            to code! Part of me wants to work industry for a specific amount of years before coming
                            back
                            to
                            education. I want to teach other people how to program and encourage them to develop
                            their
                            own
                            futures while continously practicing my skills. </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many different companies I would love to work after graduating college. I
                            would
                            love to
                            work at Disney in their Imagineering team helping to develop new softwares and ideas
                            that
                            will be
                            publically showcased for the world to see. I find the animatronics and movement of the
                            Disney
                            characters like Mator beyond fascinating. Another company I would be interested in
                            working
                            for
                            Discord! The concept of developing a free chat platform that allows people to
                            communicate
                            across the
                            world in a matter of seconds is beyond facsinating! Discord allows people to connect and
                            commnicate
                            with an extremely smooth user experience.
