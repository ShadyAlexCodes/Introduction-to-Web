                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>At the current moment in time, I am not entirely certain what my future plans are. I am looking to go
                    into the field of Conputer Science. Over the past 4 years, I have worked for a small company in Las
                    Vegas, Nevada called Code Central. At Code Central, we teach children 7 to 17 learn how to code. I
                    feel that I am able to help further these childrens careers and helping them on the path of learning
                    to code! Part of me wants to work industry for a specific amount of years before coming back to
                    education. I want to teach other people how to program and encourage them to develop their own
                    futures while continously practicing my skills. </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different companies I would love to work after graduating college. I would love to
                    work at Disney in their Imagineering team helping to develop new softwares and ideas that will be
                    publically showcased for the world to see. I find the animatronics and movement of the Disney
                    characters like Mator beyond fascinating. Another company I would be interested in working for
                    Discord! The concept of developing a free chat platform that allows people to communicate across the
                    world in a matter of seconds is beyond facsinating! Discord allows people to connect and commnicate
                    with an extremely smooth user experience.
