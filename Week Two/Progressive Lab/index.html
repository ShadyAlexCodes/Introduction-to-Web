                            Xander Endre is a Freshman at <b>Neumont College of Computer Science</b>. He
                            attends from Henderson,
                            Nevada where his family is excitedly rooting him on for his future! Over the
                            past 5 years Xander has
                            been learning to program: <b>building websites for educational institutions,
                                working for a childrens coding center, building a learning management system, and
                                building an
                                order management system for local companies</b>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Xander enjoys teaching children to code in his freetime to help them begin paving their own
                            paths.
                            He also enjoys tutoring those around him to make sure they are understanding and grasping
                            the
                            content they're learning. Xander continues to demonstrate his worth ethic through college.
                            He
                            continously uploads and publishes his work to
                            github <strong>(<a
                                    href="https://github.com/ShadyAlexCodes">https://github.com/ShadyAlexCodes</a>)</strong>
                            for future recruiters to see. He
                            anticipates
                            that uploading his work over the past couple of years will allow other developers to take a
                            look at
                            his work and be inspired to learn how to program themselves!
