                    There are a lot of things to on the internet but it comes down to what I am interested in doing for
                    the day. Depending on the day I am usually doing things for work if not playing games. The following
                    websites I listed below are common sites that I utilize on a daily basis! There are many more
                    websites than listed below that I use on a daily basis but the ones listed are my most visted.

                    One of the things I do daily on the internet is update and maintain the website for my workplace.
                    I am in charge of making sure that our wordpress website is running smoothly while developing a new
                    website built in ReactJS. This has been a big undertaking as I have been learning React as I go.
                    While doing that I am the frontend designer for Code Central's learning platform Portal. I have been
                    working closely with my managers to develop a user intuituve portal for children 7 to 17 that
                    encourage learning. This is one of my favorite things to do on the internet as it encourages me to
                    continue learning and trying new things!
